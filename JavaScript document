#Learn JavaScript for Ihan Pihalla

I thought to create this document to help learn JavaScript.
JavaScript is event-based language.
JavaScript doesn't require any compilers, servers etc. Just add JS to HTML-document inside <script>-tag and run it in browser.
Basically JavaScript is a language for front-end that can add functionality to basic HTML-pages, manipulate HTML-content, and apparently can create gamish applications too XD

Some important notices:
There's now data types, JS is loosely-typed language. Every variable is defined by var, e.g var i = 0; var s = "string"; var o = new Object; etc.
But basically every basic stuff familiar from other languages applies in JS. Loops, if-else, 

Great tutorial with lot of info here: http://www.w3schools.com/js/

Some useful stuff for this game:
Get coordinates of object
var obj = new THREE.Object3d() //Creating instance of class THREE.Object3D
obj = exampleArrayContainingObjects[index]; //Getting some object from Object3D-array and placing it to obj
var xcoordinate = obj.parent.position.x; //getting xcoordinate from obj.

Adding custom data to Object3D
obj.userData = {Country: "Seychelles", RndNumber: 123, Message: "Hiii!!"}

Getting userData
obj.parent.userData.Country //Seychelles

Printing text
if there was HTML-<div>-tag, we can with JS manipulate it's content by div-id.
<div id = "example"></div>

In JS we would have script: document.getElementByID('example').innerHTML = "Hi";
So now we have <div id = "example">Hi</div>
